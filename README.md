## Where did this idea come from? 🤔
The idea was not original on my part, because the theme already exists, and all I had to do was implement it in VS Code. In fact, the merit of creating the theme should go to GPT chat as well as its developers.

## Examples 📸
Unfortunately, providing a representation of how the project works is a somewhat complicated process due to the drop in image quality. However, with that in mind, here we will have a folder called ***'code_examples'*** where there will be a series of codes from different languages ​​that can be added in future versions.

## Some extras ➕

- Many versions
    - In principle, the GPT Chat theme has very striking and defined colors, however, for some languages ​*​(like HTML, for example)* , its colors end up losing their presence. These features will still be maintained, but can be chosen by the user who can switch between a more faithful version and another that is slightly modified. **(Coming Soon)**

- Light mode
    - In addition to a couple of similar versions that will be the user's choice, a light version of the theme may be implemented in the near future. **(even if the main characteristic of the theme is to be dark)**

- Suggestions
    - Here we have some settings in JSON format that you can (or cannot) paste into your settings.json file:
    ---
    - Turn off random colorization of bracket pairs (does not work for curly braces):
    ```
    "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": false,
    ```

    - To change the font (not advisable. This can directly imply code visibility):
    ```
    "editor.fontFamily": "'Courier New', monospace",
    -> similar to ChatGPT, or

    "editor.fontFamily": "YourFont, monospace",
    -> choose from your preference
    ```
